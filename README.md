* Use search mechanism if a cube is not captured, providing feedback of the missing cube.

## Project Structure

* Ros2-nodes is organized with launch files for configuration
* Camera for detection sweeping utilizes the implemented system camera using pipeline for color detection
* Movements are controlled with moveit, using ros2 for implementation
* Error handling by a search mechanism through attempted detection sweeping
